# prime-checker for TI-Nspire

A very simple program to check if a number is prime on the TI-Nspire calculator.

## Method

Just checking all dividers until the square root, using the simple `6k Â± 1`
optimization method ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test#Example_code)).

## Features to be implemented in the future (maybe)

 - [ ] factorisation into primes
